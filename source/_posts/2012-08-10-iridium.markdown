I want to give a shout out to a very new and very interesting project called
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/radiumsoftware/iridium/">iridium</a> from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/adman65">Adam Hawkins</a> who blogs at
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.broadcastingadam.com/">BroadcastingAdam</a>.

With more and more of the application finding its way onto the client in the form of
javascript or coffeescript, there is
now a clear separation between between this frontend end code and the backend server code that
now concerns itself with serving up JSON through a solid API.  Gone are the days when
client side code and server side code live side by side in your monolithic project
structure.  It makes more and more practical sense to segregate the two distinct layers
into two orthogonal projects evolve at
their own pace.  Projects like <a href="sinonjs.org" target="_blank">sinon.js</a>
allows us to stub out API calls that are not available or write resource free specs.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/radiumsoftware/iridium/">Iridium</a> aims
to add some much needed tooling to the front end project space and sets out with the
following goals:
- CLI driven interactions
- Expose as little Ruby as possible
- Focus on JS/CSS/HTML
- Make JS testable
