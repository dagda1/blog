- [Part 1]("http://www.thesoftwaresimpleton.com/blog/2011/09/07/site-refresh-with-html5-and-sass---part-1//") 

In the last [post]("http://www.thesoftwaresimpleton.com/blog/2011/09/07/site-refresh-with-html5-and-sass---part-1//") I took a walk through the basic set up of my sass files that I will be using for the update of my site to the new landscape of html5.

Below is the file layout for my sass files:
{% img /images/site-refresh-part1/sass-structure.png %}
I went on to mention that the **application.css.sass** file above is used as a manifest and I just use it to point to my application point of entry **screen.sass**.

application.css.sass looks like this:
{% codeblock %}
 @import "screen"
{% endcodeblock %}

screen.sass currently looks like this:
{% gist 1201022 %}

In the last post, I explained how the reset mixins in lines 2 and 3 provide a facility for removing browser inconsistencies by a mechanism known as css reset rules.  I now want to explain the contents of the other files that are imported via the sass **@import** directive.

## SASS Partials
All the files that are imported on lines 5 to 12 of screen.sass are sass partials.  Any sass file that is imported as part of a parent or main css file and does not need its own individual css file is what is known as a *partial*.  A sass partial file does not make sense on its own.  In this example, screen.sass will generate one css file that is made up of seven partials.  This is very analgous to rails partials or any partial in any mvc framework.  The convention for a sass partial is to begin the filename with a **_** character. If you refer to the opening image, each file in the partials directory begins with an underscore.  This tells sass not to generate an individual css file for the partial and only use it for imports.  To confuse matters, you drop both the *_* and the file extension in the @import statement.

The first import statement on line 5 imports a currently empty file named *_utilities.sass*.  This file will be used for housing any reusable mixins or sass functions that we create on our journey to market.  Next up we have the partial *_colors.sass*.

## SASS Variables
_colors.sass currently looks like this:
{% gist 1205627 %}

The point of *_colors.sass* is to have a central location were we can adjust the colour scheme of the website.  The explicit colour values that will be referenced in other sass files for things like background colours etc. are stored in what are known as sass variables.

One of the glaring misses in CSS is the ability to store reusable values in variables.  This can lead you to having to use potentially faulty search and replace techniques in your text editor to swap hex code values and manage colour palette changes in your stylesheets.  With sass you can assign values to variables, and manage colours, border sizes etc. in a single location.

SASS variables start with the *$* character and can contain any character that is valid in a CSS class name.  In line 1 of **_colors.sass**, I am storing the hex value of the colour that I will use for the header section of my page.  As colors.sass is imported in screen.sass, the variables that are declared in _colors.sass will be available in any partials that are imported in screen.sass.  Below is an example of how the sass variable can be used:

{% codeblock %}
body > header
  background: $header-bg
{% endcodeblock %}
Line 3 of _colors.sass contains the following variable declaration:
{% codeblock %}
$subtitle-color: lighten($header-bg, 58)
{% endcodeblock %}
The return value of the lighten function that is outlined above is used to assign the value of the $subtitle-color variable and is one of the many utility functions that are included in SASS.  The lighten function unsurprisingly lightens the colour by a percentage value.  In the above example, we can tie the $subtitle-color variable to the $header-bg variable so they will always be in ratio.  A quick look at the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_bland">sass docs</a> will broaden your knowledge of what sass functions are available.

Before carrying on, below is the rendered HTML from our main application.html.haml file which we will be applying css rules to:
{% gist 1202722 %}

## Typography

The next sass partial file that we are importing from the parent screen.sass is the **_typography.sass** file, which currently looks like this:
{% gist 1218685 %}

This file as the file name suggests is where all the type face instructions will be centrally held.  On line 1 of _typography.sass, we are declaring a css class with a name of heading and then declaring the font-family we want to use and the fall back options.  It is unlikely you will have heard of the Orbitron font-family and that is because we are importing it from the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts API</a>.  I mentioned this in the previous <a href="http://www.thesoftwaresimpleton.com/blog/2011/09/07/site-refresh-with-html5-and-sass---part-1//" target="_blank">post</a>.  We can import fonts from the google web fonts api by declaring a separate &lt;link&gt; element for each font we want to import. The declaration for importing the Orbitron font is below:
{% codeblock %}
%link{:rel => "stylesheet", :type => "text/css", :href => "http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Orbitron:regular,italic,bold,bolditalic"}
{% endcodeblock %}

On line 4 of the typography.sass file, we are using the css selector **body > header h1** to select the first **h1** element of the new html5 **header** element. On line 7 of **_typography.sass**, **@extend** is used to tell sass that we want the **body > header h1** selector to inherit all the styles defined in another selector.  This is worth the sass price of admission alone.  The ability to **DRY** up your css by inheriting other selector rules reduces repeating yourself tenfold. This is one of the many reasons why sass will (not should) become the new css.

In line 11 of _typography.sass we come across the first use of what is arguably sass's most important feature which is known as a *sass mixin*.  A *mixin* as the name suggests, mixes in rules into other rules.  We extract the rules using the **@mixin** directive.  For example we could create a *mixin* defined like below:
{% codeblock %}
@mixin BigText
  font-size: 20px
  font-weight: bold
  text-transform: uppercase
{% endcodeblock %}
We can *mixin* these rules into other rules using the **@include** directive.
{% codeblock %}
body > header h1
  @include BigText
{% endcodeblock %}
It is also possible to pass arguments to mixins just as is outlined in line 11 of typography where we are mixing in the rules of the compass <a href="http://compass-style.org/examples/compass/css3/text_shadow/" target="_blank">Text-Shadow mixin</a>.  This mixin will create the rules for the new css3 text shadow property.  The CSS3 text-shadow property has been around for some time now and is commonly used to recreate Photoshopâ€™s Drop Shadow type shading to add subtle shadows which help add depth, dimension and to lift an element from the page.
{% codeblock %}
@include text-shadow(rgba(#000, 0.8) 0 0 8px)
{% endcodeblock %}
Below is a screenshot of what the some total of our css styling looks so far:
{% img /images/site-refresh-part2/h1-part1.png %}
I think you will agree that this looks pretty ugly but as we continue, I will progressively make it look better:
{% img /images/site-refresh-part2/h1-part2.png %}
As you can see, I am not a designer but this looks reasonable enough to me but probably less so to others.  Ok, back to sass...

On line 18 of _typography.sass, we come across the strange syntax of   **#{headings()}**.  This helper <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/helpers/selectors/#headings" target="_blank">function</a> is part of the compass library.  This helper function will emit all the h[n] headings for you.  Below is the css that is rendered from this function:
{% codeblock %}
.heading, body > header h1, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: "Orbitron", "Georgia", "Helvetica Neue", Arial, San-Serif;
}
{% endcodeblock %}
I am going to leave things here for now but in the next post I will outline some other cool sass techniques such as gradients.
